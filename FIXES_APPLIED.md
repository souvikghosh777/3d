## ⚠️ Note About Warnings

You may see some warnings in VS Code:

### CSS Warnings (IGNORE THESE - They're Normal!)
- "Unknown at rule @tailwind"
- "Unknown at rule @apply"

**Why?** VS Code doesn't recognize Tailwind CSS syntax, but PostCSS processes them correctly. The app will work perfectly!

### Markdown Linting (Optional styling suggestions)
- These are just formatting suggestions for the documentation
- They don't affect functionality
